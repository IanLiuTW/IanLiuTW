#### 👋 Hi, this is Ian...
- 🤖 I specialized in Python professionally, currently expanding my tech stack with Rust, Nix, and other DevOps tools.
- ⌨️ I love Neovim. In my free time, I am actively looking to contribute to open-source projects.
- 🐬 I enjoy diving. I am an AIDA freediver and a PADI Divemaster. My deepest dives reached -42 meters in both disciplines.
- 👨‍💻 I like solving programming puzzles... for fun. I'm a daily leetcoder - [LeetCode Profile](https://leetcode.com/u/ipuppyian).
- 🎄 I do Advent of Code with Rust - [My Rust solutions of AoC 2024](https://github.com/IanLiuTW/advent-of-code-rust/tree/2024/src/bin).
